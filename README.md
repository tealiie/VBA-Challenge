# VBA-Challenge

Macro works on test data but repeatedly crashes on when used on Wall Street Data.

After trouble shooting for hours and changing the code, Wall Street Data still crashes on Excel, the curser will spin and freeze the file. Excel becomses "Application Not Responding".

Eventually was able to pull data for Wall Street 2014 and then Excel application crashed again.

Not sure what fix is when VBA works on smaller test data but not large Wall Street Data.
